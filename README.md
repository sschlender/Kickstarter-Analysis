# Kickstarter-Analysis
## Overview of Project

### Purpose

 When working with a set of data, especially a large one, it is useful to narrow down and filter the data into specific categories to make it easier to comprehend. Henceforth, by filtering the Kickstarter data into specific categories, we are more capable of understanding what the data is showing and can explain it to others. We can go further and graph the data, and have a visual representation of these filters, which makes the data even more accessable to outsiders. Specifically, the data was filtered to show the outcomes based on launch date and the outcomes based on goals.
 
## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

  After filtering the data to show the outcomes based on the launch date of the Kickstarter, there are numerous trends and anonamlies can be spotted. These trends and anomalies can be easially seen after graphing the filtered data, as seen below. On the graph, there are three lines each representing the outcomes of the projects throughout the year. Successful projects are represented by the yellow line, failed projects are represented by the orange line, and canceled projects are represented by the blue line.

  Whenn the looking at the line for successful Kickstarters there is several trends that can be spotted, the first being that their is a noticable peak in May with a steep decrease until September, with most of the first half of the year having a high probability of success. Specifically, May has the highst probability of success,Feburary having the second highest probability, and September having the second lowest porbability of success. The month with the lowest probability of success is December, where you can see a steep decline from November to December successful Kickstarters, with the amount dropping over 70 Kickstarters, the highest change of any month.
  
   The line graph for failed Kickstarters is not as extreme as the line graph for successful ones, but there are still noticable trends and anomalies that can be spotted. The first anomalie that can be spotted is the steep decrease of failed projects from Janurary to Feburary, with there being an over fourty point difference between the two months. This difference is the most extreme of the graph, but not the only one, there is two others one being from October to November, with it being over a thirty point difference, and the other being from September to October, with a over twenty point difference. There is also a longer trend of an increase of failed Kickstarters from April to June, with an increase of fourty points in this time span.
   
   When looking for the month with the highest amount of failed Kickstarters, one can notice that there are several months with either the same amount or near the same amount of failed projects. Specifically, there are four months have have a near tie in amount of failed projects, them being January, June, July, and October with these months having 149, 147, 150, and 149 respectively. The same is for the months with the lowest amount of failures, with them being Feburary, March, and April, and their failures totaling 106, 108, and 102 respectively. 
   
  The line graph for canceled projects on Kickstarter is by far the least extreme of the three, with it nearly resembling a straight line, only a few anomlies throw off the perpendicularity of the line. there are two motnhs in particular that throw this off, them being July and November. Both of these months have a spike in cancelations of projects, with them having the first and second most cancelations of projects, respectively.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

  When doing an anlysis of the data filtered by the outcomes of the Kickstarter projects based on the goal amount, there is several key differences between the outcomes of the projects. And after graphing this data the key differences between the outcomes becomes a lot clearer. This data is also filtered to only show the Kickstarter projects that fall in the subcategory of plays. Below is the said graph of outcomes based on goals. The blue line shows the percentage of successful Kickstarters across the goal ranges, the orange line shows the percentage of failed kickstarters, and the grey line shows the percentage of canceled kickstarters.

  When looking at the line graph there is two very noticable aspects to the lines, one of them being that the percentage successful and the percentage failed are mirror images of each other. This is because there are no canceled play Kickstarter projects over this time period, which causes the other anomlie, the lack of a grey line. Another significane that is noticable on the graph, is the times when the percentages of succcesses and percentages of failures swap majority. This happens three times over the goal range, mostly all happening in the upper half of the goal range. 
  
  There are two areas on the graph where the percentage of successful campaigns are higher than failed campaigns and there are two where the opposite is true. In the areas where the success rate is higher the fail rate the campaign has the best chance to come to forwishen. The two ranges that a campaign has the best chance is between $0 and $9999 and between $35000 and $34999. Whereas the opposite is true for the areas that the percentage of failed projects is higher, with the project having a higher change of failing between the ranges of $20000 to $34999 and any project above $45000.
  
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

  One conclusion that I can draw about the outcomes based on launch date of the Kickstarters is that the best month to launch a project is May. The month boasts the largest difference between successful projects and failed projects and has a relatively low probability of cancelation. May boast the highest success rate of all of the months as well, which further solidifies that May is more than likely the best month to launch a project. Another conclusion that I can draw is that the worst month to launch a Kickstarter is December, because even though there are other months with a higher amount of failures, December is the only month where the amount of failures is higher than the amount of successes.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

  One key thing that I can conclude about the outcomes based on goals, is that none of the Kickstarters in the play subcategory were canceled across this time range. Another conclustion that can be made is that the sweet spots for have a successful Kickstarter campaign across the goal range is between $0 and $9999 and between $35000 and $44999.
  
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
    
    One of the limitations of this dataset is the time line that data shows, it only shows the Kickstarter projects from up to March of 2017, which this leaves a time line gap of over four years. This large gap can potentially have significant effect on the data, for example there could be a uptick of interest in Kickstarters in recent years that this data set would not represent.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

  One chart or graph that I believe would be interesting to see, is how the country of origin affects the overall outcome of the Kickstarter project. Do certain countries have a higher success rate or failure rate?
